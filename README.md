<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
EDOCS Mobile brings <a href="https://github.com/edocs-ngx/edocs-ngx">edocs-ngx</a> to your smartphone without any compromises. While you can use edocs-ngx from a mobile browser, managing your documents this way is often a tedious and slow process. The app integrates a custom scanner, biometric authentication and many more conveniences to help you make the transition from a paper-based to a fully digital office experience.

## Troubleshooting
#### Suggestions are not selectable in any of the label form fields
This is a known issue in ealier versions (<3.x.x) and it has to do with accessibility features of Android. Password managers such as Bitwarden often caused this issue. Luckily, this can be resolved by turning off the accessibility features in these apps. This could also be observed with apps that are allowed to display over other apps, such as emulations of the dynamic island on android.
#### I cannot log in since the update to edocs-ngx 1.14.0 (and above).
The app has to somehow get information about its user from the edocs API. Therefore, the `Users -> View` and the `UISettings -> View` permissions are required for each user trying to log into the app. Otherwise, the app has no way of obtaining your user id and other information required for the usage of most features.
