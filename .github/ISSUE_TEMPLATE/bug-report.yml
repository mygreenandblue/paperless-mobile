      description: Logs can be acquired by running `flutter logs` or `adb logcat | grep flutter` while your phone is connected to the computer. Providing logs significantly increases the chance of quickly finding and fixing the issue. If your app keeps crashing on startup, connect your device to your computer, run one of these commands in the terminal and only then start the app to get all the relevant logs.
