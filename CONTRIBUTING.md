<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites
* Install an IDE of your choice (e.g. VSCode with the Dart/Flutter extensions)
* Install the flutter SDK (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) _or_ use the flutter git submodule pinned in this project by running `git submodule update --init` inside the project root directory.

## Install dependencies and generate files
1. First, clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/astubenbord/edocs-mobile.git
```

You can now run the `scripts/install_dependencies.sh` script at the root of the project, which will automatically install dependencies and generate files for both the app and local packages.

If you want to manually install dependencies and build generated files, you can also run the following commands:

### Inside the `packages/edocs_api/` folder:
2. Install the dependencies for `edocs_api`
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Build generated files for `edocs_api`
   ```sh
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```
   
### Inside the project's root folder
4. Install the dependencies for the app
   ```sh
   flutter packages pub get
   ```
5. Build generated files for the app
   ```sh
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```
6. Generate the localization files for the app
   ```sh
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```
   
## Build release version
In order to build a release version, you have to...
1. Exchange the signing configuration in android/app/build.gradle from
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    }
}
```
to 
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
    }
}
```
or use your own signing configuration as described in https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app and leave the `build.gradle` as is.

2. Build the app with release profile (here for android):
```sh
flutter build apk
```
The --release flag is implicit for the build command. You can also run this command with --split-per-abi, which will generate three separate (smaller) binaries.

3. Install the app to your device (when omitting the `--split-per-abi` flag)
```sh
flutter install
```
or when you built with `--split-per-abi`
```sh
flutter install --use-application-binary=build/pp/outputs/flutter-apk/<apk_file_name>.apk
```
